	<h1>about me</h1>
	<p>My name is Vezley - I enjoy gaming and playing the piano along with a little anime on the side. I am unsure what my future holds but I plan to keep an open mind.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>As for being a caster on twitch - I hope to at least get a quality button to ensure stability for all my viewers.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>The Vezzelution - simply a revolution that I'm starting here on twitch. To fight against anything and everything in life that brings you down. I want you to come in here and know you have a family. The Vezzelution isn't about me, but about all of us as a whole - I simply started it.</p>
